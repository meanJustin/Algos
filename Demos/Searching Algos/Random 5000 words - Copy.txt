that is to add new and interesting paragraphs to the generator if you would like to contribute some random paragraphs please contact us there are usually about  words in a paragraph but this can vary widely most paragraphs focus on a single idea that is expressed with an introductory sentence then followed by two or more supporting sentences about the idea a short paragraph may not reach even  words while long paragraphs can be over  words long but generally speaking they tend to be approximately  words in length sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes things do not work out as

head builder of human happiness no one rejects dislikes or avoids pleasure itself because it is pleasure but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself because it is pain but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure to take a trivial example which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise except to obtain some advantage from it but who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure  on the other hand we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment so blinded by desire that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain these cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish in a free hour when our power of choice is untrammeled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided but in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted the wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures or else he endures pains to avoid worse the other hand we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by

to secure other greater pleasures or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains the introduction  want to see sample essays check out our sample essay section where you can see scholarship essays admissions essays and more the principle purpose of the introduction is to present your position this is also known as the thesis or argument on the issue at hand but effective introductory paragraphs are so much more than that before you even get to this thesis statement for example the essay should begin with a hook that grabs the reader attention and makes them want to read on examples of effective hooks include relevant quotations no man is an island or surprising statistics three out of four doctors report that only then with the reader attention hooked should you move on to the thesis the thesis should be a clear one sentence explanation of your position that leaves no doubt in the reader mind about which side you are on from the beginning of your essay  following the thesis you should provide a miniaturize which previews the examples you will use to support your thesis in the rest of the essay not only does this tell the reader what to expect in the paragraphs to come but it also gives them a clearer understanding of what the essay is about  finally designing the last sentence in this way has the added benefit of seamlessly moving the reader to the first paragraph of the body of the paper in this way we can see that the basic introduction does not need to be much more than three or four sentences in length if yours is much longer you might want to consider editing it down a bit  here by way of example is an introductory paragraph to an essay in response to the following question  do we learn more from finding out that we have made mistakes or from our successful actions  no man is an island and as such he is constantly shaped and influenced by his experiences people learn by doing and accordingly learn considerably more from their mistakes than their success for proof of this consider examples from both science and everyday experience do pay attention to your introductory paragraph because this is the first paragraph of your essay it is your opportunity to give the reader the best first impression possible the introductory paragraph not only gives the reader an idea of what you will talk about but also shows them how you will talk about it put a disproportionate amount of effort into this more than the  a simple calculation would suggest and you will be rewarded accordingly  do not use passive voice or active voice wherein the subjects direct actions rather than let the actions happen to them he scored a  instead of he was given a  is a much more powerful and attention grabbing way to write at the same time unless it is a personal narrative avoid personal pronouns like i my or me try instead to be more general and you will have your reader hooked the body paragraphs the middle paragraphs of the essay are collectively known as the body paragraphs and as alluded to above the main purpose of a body paragraph is to spell out in detail the examples that support your thesis  for the first body paragraph you should use your strongest argument or most significant example unless some other more obvious beginning point as in the case of chronological explanations is required the first sentence of this paragraph should be the topic sentence of the paragraph that directly relates to the examples listed in the miniaturize of introductory paragraph  a one sentence body paragraph that simply cites the example of or jams is not enough however no following this an effective essay will follow up on this topic sentence by explaining to the reader in detail who or what an example is and more importantly why that example is relevant  even the most famous examples need context for example life was extremely complex by using him as an example do you intend to refer to his honesty bravery or maybe even his wooden teeth the reader needs to know this and it is your job as the writer to paint the appropriate picture for them to do this it is a good idea to provide the reader with five or six relevant facts about the life in general or event in particular you believe most clearly illustrates your point  having done that you then need to explain exactly why this example proves your thesis the importance of this step cannot be understated although it clearly can be underlined this is after all the whole reason you are providing the example in the first place seal the deal by directly stating why this example is relevant  here is an example of a body paragraph to continue the essay begun above  take by way of example the famed inventor rose to prominence in the late the century because of his successes yes but even he felt that these successes were the result of his many failures he did not similar to most of the written literary forms articles contain an introduction a body and a conclusion again we write an article for the target audience of course if our article fails to appeal to the target audience it would be of no use therefore articles should have a title that grabs the eyeballs of their readers  the introduction should talk more about the topic under concern in the article if the introduction is lengthy and boring the readers will bail out from reading and shift to another piece of writing  the main body should contain  to  paragraphs which further discuss the topic and explain the idea again a lengthy and boring body would distract the readers attention and discourage them from further reading hence articles should be tailored to suit the target audiences taste for example if it is meant for trade students then you should use simple terms on the contrary if it is meant for doctors it should contain a language that makes your readers feel at home  read some amazing tips on story writing here in detail  a grand ending is as important as the article itself unlike an essay where we conclude by summarizing all the ideas we have been discussing articles follow a different approach an articles ending should be out of the box something that leaves the readers thinking or calls for action ending with a question can be your best bet right solved question for you q identify the best article heading for the following topic un has recognized the toy train of as a world

and the nuanced differences between users of various backgrounds egg different age groups gender identities make it especially difficult to derive sufficiently valuable insights based on single

communities online this is especially valuable given the waves of protests uprisings and revolutions that have swept the region during the last decade although we create new models for tasks such as sentiment analysis and gender detection as part of arrant our primary focus is to provide strong baselines across the various tasks we believe this will facilitate comparisons across models this is
